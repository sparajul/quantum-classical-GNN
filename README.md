%Quantum Interaction Graph Neural Network (QIGNN)

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a Quantum-enhanced Interaction Graph Neural Network (QIGNN) for edge classification on event-based graph data.

The model integrates quantum neural networks into a message-passing GNN using PennyLane, PyTorch Geometric, and PyTorch Lightning.

Scope: Research prototype / proof-of-concept.

Application: Edge classification on event graphs (e.g. tracking)
